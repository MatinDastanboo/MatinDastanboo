# 👋 Hi, I’m Matin Dastanboo

MSc student in **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**  
at **Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University (SPbPU)**.

As a MSc student in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at SPbPU, actively developing a broad foundation in AI. Past projects were conducted mainly for practical learning. My research interest is medical AI, and I am currently working on AI-based approaches for Alzheimer’s disease detection.
